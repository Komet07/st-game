Jumpgates

  Lead to different Ares ("Sectors", can sometimes be in the same Star system; sometimes they're not)
  
  Two Sizes: 
    - Minor Jumpgates (Connect Intra-System sectors)
    - Major Jumpgates (Connect sectors which are not in the same system)
    
  Require:
    - Reactor Components
    - Energy Cells
    - Quantum Chips
    
  Gradually open up more Jump Gates, and then expand the game into more sectors (i.e. at the start you only have access to 2 sectors, in the end there's 8-10)
  
NPC Pilots Employed by you
  
  Ability to hire NPC pilots to fly ships of yours (which you have to build, naturally), and trade in a sector. (Limited amount of wares, maybe 3-4 max)
